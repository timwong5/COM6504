## Errors need to be fixed
+ When refresh the index page, console shows the service-worker "uncaught (in promise) typeerror: failed to execute 'addall' on 'cache': request failed"
+ Can't get the annotation by ajax now - try to fix.
+ Only can show the "History" in front of the users in Chat history - try to fix.
+ When users get chat history, they get a space line under the origin chat history.
+ Even don't fill in the name or roomID, user can still get the chat history.
+ Sometimes users can't get the image from the Internet - maybe cross-domain problem.
